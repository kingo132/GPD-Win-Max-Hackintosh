# GPD-Win-Max-Hackintosh
Hello, everyone. This is a repository discussing how to install Mac OS Catalina (or newer version) on GPD Win Max.

Thanks to all the volunteers who participated in this project. We have achieved the minimal requirement to use Mac OS on this little machine.

However, there's still some difficult problem need to be solved. We are currently trying to solve them in our leisure time. The progress may very slow. If you are also interested, join us to solve them together.
